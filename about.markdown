I am half Mexican and Honduran born and raised in Yakima, Washington. I attended at Eisenhower High School and graduated in 2011.  I then went to Central Washington University for about 2 1/2 years and returned to Yakima. I attended Yakima Valley Community College and graduated with my AA in arts. I now attend at Eastern Washington University and my major is Visual Communication Design.
